# PyTorch-regression-project-to-decrease-time-spent-in-traffic

This is the source code and data set for my blog post here - http://simpleconcepts.org/predict-the-best-time-to-commute-to-office-by-avoiding-traffic-jams-machine-learning-application-by-using-pytorch-regression/

Traffic jams are a big problem worldwide.

I have made a Feedforward neural network for regression using Pytorch where I feed the commute data and get the best time on a particular day to start for office and thereby spend the least amount of time in traffic jams. 

This can also serve as a template for PyTorch regression problems.
